If Everyone Cared
    --by Nickelback
From underneath the trees， we watch the sky.
Confusing stars for satellites.
I never dreamed that you'd be mine.
But here we are， we're here tonight.
Singing amen， I'm alive.
And in the air the fire flies.
Our only light in paradise.
We'll show the world they were wrong.
And teach them all to sing along.
Singing amen I'm alive.
We'd see the day when nobody died.
And as we lie beneath the stars.
We realize how small we are.
If they could love like you and me.
Imagine what the world could be.
If everyone cared and nobody cried.
If everyone loved and nobody lied.
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride.
